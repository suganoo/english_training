Six ways the U.S. isn't ready for wars of the future

Given the combination of COVID-19, economic turbulence and an election year, Americans can be forgiven
if international security has been pushed out of mind. Congress, fortunately, has not been so distracted:
The House Armed Service Committee recently passed a $740 billion annual defense authorization bill.

The measure addressed several hot-button issues specifically - a raise for the troops, Confederate symbol on bases,
limiting the president's ability to pull out toops from Europe and Afghanistan. But the longer-term questions and
murkier: What are the key areas in which the United States must invest to prepare for deterrence and combat
operations in the 21st century?
There are plenty of very smart people looking at this question. Each of the armed forces has some version of a think
tank wrestling with its future. The Army, for example, created the U.S. Futures Command in Austin, Texas - an excellent
location given the confluence of tech and cyber companies, a major research university and military-fiendly state.
One dynamic group there, Team Ignite, is looking at how warfare will change in the 2040-2050 time frame.
This echoes work done at the Rand Corp. immediately after World War II in understanding how big technology changes
can affect warfare. Team Ignite is trying to understand the fusion between artificial inteligence, biotech, space,
machine learning and other trends. Another new effort is the Aire Force's Global Futures Report, which is both
geopolitical and technological in its approach.
