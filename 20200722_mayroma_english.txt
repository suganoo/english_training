It is not a good idea to host the Olympic Games in Japan.
Hosting the Olympic Games requires a huge sum of public and private expenditures. I do not believe the general public will happily
support the idea. In addition, not all of the tax payers are big fans of sports. Some of them may not enjoy huge sports events.
I also doubt the economic impact of the Games towards the Japanese economy. Moreover, the Japanese summer is hot and humid, which
is not an ideal environment for outdoor sports events.
