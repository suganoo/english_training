In 2014 the Japanese government hosted a conference which had the objectives to improve mutual understanding of Japan and Asia

It is not a good idea to host the Olympic Games in Japan.
Hosting the Olympic Games requires a huge sum of public and private expenditures. I do not believe the general public will happily
support the idea. In addition, not all of the tax payers are big fans of sports. Some of them may not enjoy huge sports events.
I also doubt the economic impact of the Games towards the Japanese economy. Moreover, the Japanese summer is hot and humid, which
is not an ideal environment for outdoor sports events.

Holding the Olympic Games in Japan is a bad idea. Hosting the Olympic Games is extremely expensive. For example, the final bill
for the 2012 Olympic Games was ￡24billion, which was ten times higher than the original estimate. The high cost of the event will divide
public opinion. Japan has huge national debt, and the budget deficit is increasing the debt every year. The Olympic Games is a festival
which is centered upon different sports. However, many people dislike sports and will not attend any of the events in the forthcoming
Tokyo Olympics.

On October 4th I went to a factory at Poissy to see Mr White, the operation manager. Mr White and I had a meeting for one hour at
his office. I asked him what the problem parts of the widgets are, and I also sought his advise on how to fix the problem parts.

The ABC Helper Company has been given the contract to provide solutions to the problem parts. Their deadline is the end of October.
Mr White will deliver a report on the problem parts which have been identified and the budget which has been allocated to pay the
subcontractor to provide solutions. I will provide the Executive with a full commentary on Mr White's report, including any legal
ramifications of the project.
